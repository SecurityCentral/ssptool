        'There are three types of Tower users that can be assigned:

        - Normal User
        Normal Users have read and write access limited to the resources
        (such as inventory, projects, and job templates) for which that user
        has been granted the appropriate roles and privileges.

        - System Auditor
        Auditors implicitly inherit the read-only capability for all objects
        within the Tower environment.

        - System Adminisrator
        A Tower System Administrator (also known as a Superuser) has admin,
        read, and write privileges over the entire Tower installation. A
        System Administrator is typically responsible for managing all
        aspects of Tower and delegating responsibilities for day-to-day
        work to various Users.

        Ansible Tower uses role-based access control to provide the ability
        to read, modify, and administer projects, inventories, job templates,
        and other Ansible Tower elements. The role-based access control policies
        can be defined per-user, or per user type as indicated above.

        Additional detail can be found in the Ansible Tower documentation:

        https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/users.html'

## CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
##

# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implimentation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).
#
#       In case the customer desires components (e.g. Red Hat Identity
#       Management Admins) to handle configuration management the
#       lines below can be uncommented:
